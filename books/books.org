* *Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl* - _Carrie Brownstein_
Carrie Brownstein's memoir of the first ~20 years of Sleater-Kinney, and her formative years in
Washington and Oregon.

- It's a slightly disappointing read, because of the remove that's kept between the author and the
  reader when dealing with the most pivotal moments of the band's history. Firing a drummer is given
  short-shrift, as is the final implosion (far more attention is given to CB's ailments and pets
  than really interrogating the reason she blew up the band during The Woods' tour).
- The sense you get is that certain episodes in CB's past are still to painful
